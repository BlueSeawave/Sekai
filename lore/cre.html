  <div>In the beginning there was only chaos Itus, and from chaos the first realm, “Farlands” arose.

The farland became the start of order Nerit.

When the farlands were made Order and Chaos became the first gods, by the names of Itus and Nerit. They walked the Farlands and found it empty.

But as the farlands had things previously unheard of and the void left for by the governing of everything that was would not last, the second generation of gods where made
     <br>
Leisa: Goddess of the Nature
Racu: God of Death
     <br>
Sarit: God of Justice
     <br>
Huro : God of War
     <br>
Teru : Goddess of Knowledge
     <br>

Of course more gods were gods, but only the third through seventh was designed.

But the Farlands were not enough for the gods so they made the outer planes to rule over, agreeing to leave the farlands out of their squabbles.

But as only Itus och Nerit could make new planes they decided to split the deed, Itus made the negative and Nerit made the positive, they let the neutral be made by the combination of both of them.

To channel more sophisticated powers rather than the raw powers of chaos and order, or good and evil they by the advice of Teru made the elemental planes.

Left was only the planes of mortals and as such:

Through the power of Itus, Racu made the shadowfell and through the power of Nerit, Leisa made the feywild.

Left was only the material plane, on which all of the gods were allowed to act.

Most of the mortals were not aligned with any of the gods, allowed to do as they pleased, good or evil, order or chaos, or simply not taking a side.

Many of the material planes were made, an infinite amount to be precise, and once they were done they all agreed to make a separate plane, one not naturally connected to magic, allowing the mortals to live out their lives.

This plane was known as Sekai, and once the mortals came their first they begged the gods to change their minds but as the plane had already been made there was no natural magic anchored to the plane. To change this the 6 exulars where made
